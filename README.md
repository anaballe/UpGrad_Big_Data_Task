# UpGrad_Big_Data_Task

In this repository I have done the assignment task for UpGrad Big Data Internship.


final_compiled.txt is the file I have obtained after doing a inner join of (union of join2_genchanA.txt,join2_genchanB.txt and join2_genchanC.txt) and (union of join2_gennumA.txt,join2_gennumB.txt and join2_gennumC.txt).These file can been obtained from https://github.com/mishranurag96/Big_Data_DataSet.

This text file has been utilized for using MapReduce paradigm, Hive and pig programming.

Problem statement: 

•What is the total number of viewers for shows on ABC?

•What is the number of viewers for the BAT channel? 

•What is the most viewed show on ABC channel?

•What are the aired shows on ZOO,NOX, ABC channels ?

Solution :-

1) Java code having Mapper,Reducer and Driver programs can been found separately in UpGrad_Big_Data_Task/Java code Using Mapreduce Framework/src/

2)task.hql in the UpGrad_Big_Data_Task/Task in Hive/ contains the Hive queries for all four tasks.

3)task_in_pig.pig in UpGrad_Big_Data_Task/Task in Pig/ contains the pig latin script which can be run.
